					<h2>FNG, Welcome!</h2>

					<div class="info-grid">
						<div class="info-item">
							<h3>It starts at 5:30 a.m (usually).</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="info-item">
							<p>Ah, the biggest barrier to showing up. We know it sounds crazy-and it sounds weird saying this, but you will come to genuinely love waking up early and getting a jump start on your day.</p>
							<p>You'll also love the time you get to yourself without emails, kids, spouses, and daily life creeping in. F3 is a break from all of that.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<div class="info-grid">
						<div class="info-item">
							<h3>It's a 45 minute boot-camp style workout.</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="info-item">
							<p>F3 is a peer-lead, non-professional boot camp-style workout.</p>
							<p>Everyday is different (depending on who is leading) but the exercises are typically running, pushups, jumping jacks, burpees, stuff like that — and then occasionally doing something called "Murder Bunnies" with a cinder block, but I don't want to freak you out.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<div class="info-grid">
						<div class="info-item">
							<h3>It's always outside - usually at a park or school.</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="info-item">
							<p>We literally meet in parking lots of parks and schools around Tulsa. I got to tell you, those places where your kids play baseball look completely different at 5:30 a.m.</p>
							<p>A core principle of F3 is that the workouts are always held outdoors. It's dark, quiet, and wonderful. We call it "The Gloom."</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<div class="info-grid">
						<div class="info-item">
							<h3>No one will yell at you. It's not a competition. It's just you versus you.</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="info-item">
							<p>So if you're imagining a drill Sargent yelling at you to do pushups, you've got it all wrong. In fact, it's pretty much the opposite of that.</p>
							<p>The men of F3 Tulsa are here to encourage you, whatever your ability, age or fitness level.</p>
							<p>We have the saying "Leave no man behind, but leave him better than you found him."</p>
							<p>So no yelling. Just the occasional fist bump.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<div class="info-grid">
						<div class="info-item">
							<h3>It's completely free. No strings.</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="info-item">
							<p>So yeah, F3 is a free men's workout. There is nothing to buy. No up sell, or cult to join. There's no points or rewards. No affiliate program or multi-level pyramid of recruitment incentives. It's just simply free.</p>
							<p>There is nothing to rent. No one to pay. Just a group of guys that come together at 5:30 a.m. in outdoor places around Tulsa to work out.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<div class="info-grid">
						<div class="info-item">
							<h3>It has nothing to do with religion.</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="info-item">
							<p>F3 stands for Fitness, Fellowship & Faith®.</p>
							<p>The faith thing can be a turn off to some men – so let's unpack it a little. F3 is not a Christian organization. A lot of men in the group are, but F3 itself has nothing to do with any religion.</p>
							<p>We end every workout with a positive thought for the day. It could be a reflection or perspective from whomever is leading the workout. Some may call that a prayer. Whatever you call it, it's food for the soul.</p>
							<p>Our version of faith isn't to get you to join a church – we just want you to believe in something bigger than yourself. Even if it's the man next to you.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<div class="info-grid">
						<div class="info-item">
							<h3>It's all ages. There are men from 22 - 65.</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="info-item">
							<p>F3 is open to all men. We don't care if you're in your 20s or 70s, you have a place here. The nature of our workouts is you versus you. No matter your age, F3 will have you push yourself, without hurting yourself.</p>
							<p>Besides, there are some 60 year olds in the group who put us all to shame. Respect, Respect.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<div class="info-grid">
						<div class="info-item">
							<h3>There are multiple locations around the Tulsa metro.</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="info-item">
							<p>F3 Tulsa is held on some of the finest parking lots and parks in Tulsa.</p>
							<p>We keep expanding around Tulsa county. Any location is probably only a 15-minute drive from your house. That means you can sleep in until 5 a.m.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<div class="info-grid">
						<div class="info-item">
							<h3>But I can't do a _______! I haven't worked out in years.</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="info-item">
							<p>Wait, wait. Let me make sure I understand. You can't do push ups? You're not a runner? You're about 50 lbs. overweight? You've never worked out in your life and you don't know how? You're maybe a little embarrassed by your physical condition?</p>
							<p>Perfect. Start tomorrow. There will be other men there in the same boat as you. No one will judge you on your shape — and they won't try to "motivate you" into shape.</p>
							<p>They will just be by your side during the workout, and probably offer you coffee afterwards. You got this.</p>
